# 🐰✨ Data Engineering Learning Journal ✨🐰

Hi hi! Welcome to my **Data Engineering adventure log** 🌸  
This repo is where I capture my notes, reflections, and experiments from the **FTW DE Track**.

## 📚 What’s Inside?
- 📝 **Daily journals** → quick entries after each session  
- 💻 **SQL snippets & hands-on tasks** → practice + experiments  
- 💡 **Reflections** → what clicked, what confused me, and my little “aha!”s  
- 🎨 **Visualizations** → because charts deserve to look cute too  

---

## 🧠 DE Mindset (my cozy reminders)
- 🍫 Raw stays **raw** → Clean → Mart  
- 🧩 Reproducible > manual hacks  
- 🐾 Small, atomic commits = easy to track progress  
- 💖 Data quality isn’t extra polish — it’s the main ingredient  
- 🌟 Always explain the *why*, not just the *what*
