# 🌷 Day 1 – SQL & ELT Basics
📅 2025-09-13  

---

## 1) What I learned 🌱
- How to keep a learning journal 📔  
- DE workflow: Raw → Clean → Mart  
- SQL “Big 6”: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY  
- Tools: dlt, dbt, ClickHouse, DBeaver, Metabase  
- Data quality is part of the pipeline, not optional  
- Visualization helps turn queries → insights 

---

## 2) New vocabulary ✏️
- **OLAP** — A type of database good for analysis & reporting (not transactions).  
- **ClickHouse** — A super fast column-oriented SQL database.  
- **dbt** — Tool for transforming & testing data with SQL (like magic for pipelines!).  
- **dlt** — Python library that helps load messy data into neat datasets.  
- **ELT** — Extract, Load, Transform (opposite order of ETL).  
- SQL — Structured Query Language for asking questions from data.  

---

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied 🧠
- Raw stays raw → Clean → Mart  
- Small changes, frequent commits 🐾  
- Cleaning = building trust in data  

---

## 4) Decisions & assumptions ⚖️
- I practiced SQL on the **Auto MPG dataset** 🚗  
  - Assumed horsepower missing values should be handled with NULL.  
  - Decided to clean text inconsistencies (like “?”) instead of dropping rows.  
  - Trade-off: more effort in cleaning, but results are more reliable.  

---

## 5) Open questions ❓
- What is a **data lake**? 🦆💧  
- How does dbt actually “test” data?  
- When should I use ELT vs ETL?

## 6) Next actions ✅
- [ ] Review SQL GROUP BY & HAVING  
- [ ] Try building my first dbt model

## 7) Artifacts & links 🔗

- My first SQL query in ClickHouse (mpg vs horsepower)

### ✨ Mini reflection
I was surprised at how quickly SQL felt natural, it’s like talking to the database directly!  
If I could redo, I’d spend more time on the differences between OLAP and OLTP.  
In production, I’ll watch out for **data quality issues** early before they sneak into the mart layer.
